1. Install OpenSSH server via 'Optional features'
2. Go to C:\ProgramData\ssh (by default OpenSSH server works on Administrator account, so C:\Users\<user>\.ssh folder is not used for configuration)
3. Uncomment PubkeyAuthentication yes 
4. Create administrators_authorized_keys file and copy public key to it
5. Restart OpenSSH server via Services app
